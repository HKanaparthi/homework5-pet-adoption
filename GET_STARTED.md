## 🚀 Next Steps (Do These Now!)

### Step 1: Customize Your Information (2 minutes)

1. **Open `src/index.md`** in your text editor
2. **Find line 8-9** and update:
   ```markdown
   **Student Information:**
   Name: [Your First Name] [Your Last Name]  ← CHANGE THIS
   Student ID: [Your Student ID]              ← CHANGE THIS
   ```

### Step 2: Set Your Repository Name (1 minute)

1. **Open `observablehq.config.js`**
2. **Find line 10** and change:
   ```js
   base: "/homework5-observable",  // Change to YOUR repo name!
   ```
   - Use the name you'll give your GitHub repository
   - Must start with `/`
   - Example: `/my-pet-analysis`

### Step 3: Test Locally (3 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

Verify that:
- ✅ Your name appears at the top
- ✅ All charts load and show data
- ✅ Interactive filters work (try clicking them!)
- ✅ Tooltips appear when you hover over charts

### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub (5 minutes)

Follow the instructions in `QUICK_START.md`:

1. Create a new **PUBLIC** repository on GitHub
2. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Pet adoption dashboard"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
4. Wait 2 minutes for deployment

### Step 5: Submit to Canvas

1. Copy your live URL: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/`
2. Test it in an incognito browser
3. Submit to Canvas with source code

## 📋 What Your Dashboard Includes

### Research Questions Investigated

1. **Species Adoption Analysis**
   - Which species are most successfully adopted?
   - Interactive toggle between count and rate views
   - Bar chart visualization

2. **Adopter Demographics & Preferences**
   - How does adopter age relate to pet species choices?
   - Scatter plot with species filtering
   - Explore relationship between age and previous pet ownership

3. **Additional Analyses**
   - Pet age distribution by species (box plots)
   - Adoption timeline trends over time
   - Summary statistics cards

### Interactive Features

1. **Radio Buttons** - Switch between adoption count and rate views
2. **Species Checkboxes** - Filter visualizations by pet species
3. **Date Range Selector** - Explore adoption trends over time
4. **Rich Tooltips** - Hover over any data point for details

### Design & Insights

- Professional color scheme (Tableau10 palette)
- Responsive layout with grid cards
- Comprehensive insights section explaining:
  - Design rationale
  - Key observations
  - Data patterns discovered

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Want to modify visualizations?

All code is in `src/index.md`. The file is well-commented and uses Observable Plot, which is easy to customize.

### Want to use different data?

1. Replace `data/pet_adoption_center.csv` with your file
2. Update the data loading in `src/index.md`
3. Modify visualizations to match your data structure

### Want to change colors or styling?

- Scroll to the bottom of `src/index.md` for the `<style>` section
- Modify the Observable Plot `color` scheme
- Adjust card styling, fonts, spacing, etc.

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Quick Checks
```bash
# Verify setup
./verify-setup.sh

npm run dev
# Then press F12 in browser to see console

# Build locally to test
npm run build
```

### Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Charts not showing | Check data file path in src/index.md |
| 404 on GitHub Pages | Verify base path matches repo name exactly |
| Build fails | Run `npm run build` locally to see errors |
| Git issues | Make sure repository is PUBLIC |
